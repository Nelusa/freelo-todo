# Description

The goal is to create a To-Do app using Vue and the state management library Vuex. You can use the task row that you have coded up as the To-Do item from your previous assignment. You will encounter both options and composition API in our codebase - new components should only be written in script setup syntax coupled with TS, but you can use options API here if you prefer.

## Requirements - what should it be able to do

- create new To-Do lists
- create new To-Dos
- edit To-Do
- mark To-Do as finished
- delete To-Do
- filter To-Dos by their name, globally across multiple To-Do lists

## Aditional features - something that would be nice, but is not required

- store the To-Dos in localStorage
- drag & drop to reorder To-Dos (we use SortableJS - https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable)
  alternativaly you can use the VueUse wrapper for SortableJS if you prefer.
- drag & drop to move To-Do item between To-Do lists
